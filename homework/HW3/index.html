    <br/><br/>For this problem, consider only  differences between WS1 and WS2. These two watersheds
    are adjacent to each other, and we expect they experience the same storms leading to peak runoff.
    WS2 is the control, but WS1 was actively 100% clearcut from late 1962 to 1966. Here we want to 
    test whether the difference in peak flows between WS1 and WS2 is statistically different in 4 
    periods (labeled Index12), where 1 indicates the control period pre-treatment, 2 indicates the 
    period of active treatment, 3 indicates the first 15 years post-treatment (when the forest would 
    start to recover), and 4 indicates longer than 15 years post-treatment. We want to know whether 
    the four periods are statistically different from each other, and if so, which one or ones are 
    statistically different from which other ones.

  <ol type='A'>
  
    <li>
        First, plot the timeseries of peakflow as a function of wateryear for both
        watershed 1 and watershed 2 on the same graph, with vertical dashed lines to
        indicate the different periods (put a vertical dashed line in 1963, in 1967, and in
        1982).

    <li>
        It has been suggested that paired data such as this can be made to be closer to
        normally distributed by taking the log of each value before subtracting. Create
        two series: Q12=Peakflow1-Peakflow2; and Qlog12=log(Peakflow1)-
        log(Peakflow2); and make graphs to demonstrate which is closer to normally
        distributed. (You may be interested in the normplot command in matlab.) Given
        that we want to use an ANOVA analysis, why is it important to do this
        transformation?
    </li>
    
    <li>
        State the null and the alternative hypothesis for the question of whether the four
        periods are statistically different from each other. State the type I error (alpha
        value) that you are willing to accept.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Perform an ANOVA test and discuss the results, related both to your hypothesis
        test in C and to the more detailed question of which groups are statistically
        different from which other groups. Include graphs and/or tables that illustrate
        your results, and be sure to discuss what they mean.

    USGS gaged streamflow records for the Columbia 
    River at The Dalles, OR begin in 1878 and continue to the present day (one of the longest 
    continuous records in the U.S.). Peak flow records (based on peak stage values recorded by 
    railroad workers), however, extend back even farther to 1858. Using coincident peak flow records 
    from 1879-1932 (a period with no major storage dams on the Columbia):

  <ol type='A'>
  
    <li>
        First, isolate the period of relevant overlap (1879-1932) and plot the timeseries.
        Create a regression model for annual flow using spring peak flow as an
        explanatory variable.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        How much of the variance is explained by the resulting model?
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Estimate the 95% confidence bounds for the annual flow estimates from 1858-
        1877, and plot them with the central tendency (the prediction from the regression
        model).
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Now create a non-parametric, quantile-based regression model using the same
        data.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Plot the predictions and residuals for the two different prediction models for the
        training period (1879-1932) and plot the model predictions for the pre-1878 data
        for the two different models. Is there a substantial difference between the two
        model formulations?
