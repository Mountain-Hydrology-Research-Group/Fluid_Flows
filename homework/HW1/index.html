  <h1>Homework 1</h1>
  
  <h2>Due Wednesday, October 3 before or at the start of class.</h2>
  <h2>In this homework assignment we will work with programming and data visualization to better qualitatively understand the datasets that we will be using in the upcoming homework assignments for the rest of the quarter.  Be sure to save your work, as you will see these datasets again!</h2>
  
  <p><b>Problem 1: Exploring Non-Stationary Flood Statistics</b></p>
  <p>Download the files containing observed instantaneous peak flow data for the Sauk River and Skykomish Rivers in western WA from the Files/Week 1 area of the Canvas site.  Both Excel (.xls) and Matlab (.mat) files have been provided – you may use either, but I suggest you use the opportunity to familiarize yourself with Matlab.  Note that annual peak flows are reported by water years (which cover Oct 1 of the previous year to September 30), so some years appear to have two values.  (For clarification, the water years are shown in an additional column in the excel files.)  For the purposes of this assignment, we will only consider peak flows by water year, and the years requested below refer to water years.  (For example, the first flood reported in the Skykomish occurred on Oct 10, 1928 – this is the flood of water year 1929.)</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Plot the data from the two streamflow sites as a time series from 1929-2009, with an open circle representing each peak flow value.  Be sure to label your axes appropriately and label which graph is associated with which river.  Describe qualitatively any changes you see in these records through time. Is there a common theme between the two sites?</li>
    <li>For the Sauk River only, graphically examine the entire timeseries and the peak flows occurring before and after 1975 (1929-1974, and 1975-2009).  Prepare the following plots, taking care to make sure that they are well-labeled, readable, and convey meaningful information.</li>
  </ul>
