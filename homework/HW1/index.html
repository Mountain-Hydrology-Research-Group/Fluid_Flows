  <h1>Homework 1</h1>
  
  <h2>Due Wednesday, October 3 before or at the start of class.</h2>
  <p>In this homework assignment we will work with programming and data visualization 
     to better qualitatively understand the datasets that we will be using in the 
     upcoming homework assignments for the rest of the quarter.  Be sure to save your 
     work, as you will see these datasets again!</p>
  
  <p><b>Problem 1: Exploring Non-Stationary Flood Statistics</b></p>

  </ul>
    
  <p>Download the files containing observed instantaneous peak flow data for the Sauk 
    River and Skykomish Rivers in western WA from the Files/Week 1 area of the Canvas 
    site.  Both Excel (.xls) and Matlab (.mat) files have been provided – you may use 
    either, but I suggest you use the opportunity to familiarize yourself with Matlab.  
    Note that annual peak flows are reported by water years (which cover Oct 1 of the 
    previous year to September 30), so some years appear to have two values.  (For 
    clarification, the water years are shown in an additional column in the excel 
    files.)  For the purposes of this assignment, we will only consider peak flows by 
    water year, and the years requested below refer to water years.  (For example, the 
    first flood reported in the Skykomish occurred on Oct 10, 1928 – this is the flood 
    of water year 1929.)</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Plot the data from the two streamflow sites as a time series from 1929-2009, 
      with an open circle representing each peak flow value.  Be sure to label your 
      axes appropriately and label which graph is associated with which river.  
      Describe qualitatively any changes you see in these records through time. Is 
      there a common theme between the two sites?</li>
    <li>For the Sauk River only, graphically examine the entire timeseries and the 
      peak flows occurring before and after 1975 (1929-1974, and 1975-2009).  Prepare 
      the following plots, taking care to make sure that they are well-labeled, 
      readable, and convey meaningful information.</li>
    <ul class="indented">
      <li>Histograms for the Sauk River for the entire period and each of the sub-
        periods (3 total).</li
      <li>Quantile plots using the Cunnane plotting position (see section 2.1.3 in H&H) 
        for the Sauk River for the entire period, and for each sub-period.  The 3 plots 
        should be plotted on one graph, with different line types and a legend.</li>
      <li>PDFs for the Sauk River for the entire period, and for each sub-period.  The 3 
        plots should be plotted on one graph, with different line types and a legend.</li>
      <li>For each of the sub-groupings in 2, estimate the sample mean and standard deviation.  
        Assuming a Gaussian distribution, add theoretical curves to the plots in 2 for Gaussian 
        CDFs that have the same means and standard deviations as calculated for the actual data.  
        (The graph should now have 6 lines – label carefully.)</li>
      <li>Box and whisker plots for each of the periods above (total, pre-1975 and post-1975), 
        with appropriate labels.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Based on the plots you have created, discuss whether or not you think a change has 
      occurred in the peak flows around 1975.  Be sure to reference your plots (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc.) when 
      you discuss them. </li>
  </ul>
