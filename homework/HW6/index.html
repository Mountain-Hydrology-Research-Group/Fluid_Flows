  <h2>Due Thurs., November 7th before or at the start of class.</h2>

  <p><b>Problem 1: Markov Chains (40%)</b></p>
  
  <p>
    Download the spreadsheet ENSO_to2020.xls. (And yes, the current status of ENSO, neutral, is for water year 2020.) [Not required for the homework, but if you’re curious to learn
    more about ENSO and its impacts, see this website: https://www.climate.gov/enso ]

    <li>
        Using the time series of the phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (warm (El
        Nino) =1, neutral=2, cool (La Nina) =3) from 1900-2020, create a lag-1 Markov model of
        the ENSO phase.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Using this Markov model and a random number generator, simulate 5,000 years of
        ENSO data.
    </li>
    
    <li>
       Using this stochastically generated data, answer the following questions.  According to the model, what is the probability that three warm ENSO years would occur in a row?  (Try refreshing the numbers several times to increase the sample size if the condition never happens.)   What is the large-sample probability that three cool ENSO years would happen in a row? 
    </li>
    
  </ol>

  <p><b>Problem 2: Application of Bayes Theorem (40%)</b></p>
  
   <p>
Following the Week 6 Lab, explore how the rating curve and its associated uncertainty change whether you use least squares fitting, direct monte carlo parameter estimation, or Bayesian MCMC fitting to determine the rating curve and 95% confidence intervals for the Lyell Fork streamflow site.  Create plots and discuss what you did.

  <p>
      Read Reichle’s “Data assimilation methods in the Earth sciences”, available as reichle-
      2008.pdf above and answer the following in your own words:
  </p>
  
  <ol type='A'>
  
    <li>
      In the simple data assimilation system (section 2.1), what is the Kalman gain? What
      does it do, and why is it important?
    </li>
    
    <li>
      According to Rolf Reichle, what are some of the greatest continuing challenges in
      data assimilation (see section 3)? List at least 3 and for each, give an example of how
      scientists are dealing with this challenge.
    </li>
