  <ol type="A">
    <li>Decide which of your plots from Homework 1 are relevant to the questions of
      whether a change in flood statistics occurred in the Sauk around 1977. Include
      these graphs here and discuss what you can see visually in the graphs that would
      lead you to believe that a change has or has not occurred.</li>
    <li>(Make sure you are using the updated data through 2017.) Postulating a change
      in flood statistics around 1977, test for statistical significance of the observed
      change in the mean annual flood. Use a two sample test, and alpha = 0.05 (i.e. 95%
      confidence) and the z distribution to define the rejection region (why is this
      appropriate?). Compare the period from 1977-2017 to the data from 1929-1976,
      accounting for the different sample sizes and sample standard deviations
      appropriately. For your null hypothesis, postulate that the difference between the
      two means = 0, and state the alternative hypothesis that the difference has changed
      (although you don’t know the direction of this change) and the appropriate test
      statistic. Can you reject the null hypothesis? Calculate P. How would your estimate
      of P change if your null hypothesis is that the difference in the mean between the
      two data sets is equal to 20% of the pre-1977 sample mean? (In other words, the null
      hypothesis is that the mean of the second period is 1.2 times the mean of the first period.)</li>
    <li>What is the type II error and power for your test on the mean in the first part of B
      above? To answer this, assume that the true mean has in fact increased by 20%, and
      pooled standard deviation has increased by a factor of 1.2. In other words, assume
      that the “true” mean is 1.2 times the 1929-1976 mean, and that the “true” pooled
      standard deviation is 1.2 times sigma prime (our test estimate of pooled estimator
      for the two observed data sets). Draw a graphic to represent this true distribution,
      and draw where your test statistic falls on this graph. Color the area of the graph
      that represents type II error. Then answer the question (what is the type II error
      and power for your test in part B).</li>
    <li>Now test the significance of the change in the mean between the two sample
      periods using the two-sample Wilcoxan Rank Sum test. How different is your
      conclusion from the one in part B. (i.e. compare P for the two tests).</li>
    <li>Lastly test for statistical significance of a change in the standard deviation. Even
      though it is not strictly true, assume for the moment that the sample data are
      derived from a normally distributed population. (We will follow up on the
      importance of this assumption in problem 2.) Use a single sample test (with
      rejection region based on the Chi Squared distribution). Assume that the
      sample standard deviation that you calculated from the 1929-1976 data is close to
      the true population standard deviation that you are testing for a change from.</li>
  </ol>
<br/>
<p><b>Problem 2: Monte Carlo Tests</b></p>

<p>In this exercise we will estimate the statistical significance of the changes in the
  mean and standard deviation in Problem 1 using a Monte Carlo approach.
  Conduct the analysis for the Sauk Data peak flows for water years 1929 to 2017.
  Start by creating CDFs of annual peak flow for the two periods of analysis in
  Problem 1, using the Cunnane quantile estimator discussed in class. Note: If you are
  using VLOOKUP in Excel, you will need to linearly extend your CDF to 0 and 1 so that
  you can translate all values.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Generate 500 samples, each with n = 41, assuming the CDF from the 1929-1976
    data from problem 1. Use the uniform random number generator in Matlab (or Excel
    if you are struggling with Matlab, although it will take longer in Excel) and the CDF
    you created above, following the methods discussed in class (see the sample
    spreadsheet referenced in the notes for specific coding details).</li>
  <li>For each of the 500 samples, calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.</li>
  <li>Take the 500 sample means and sample standard deviations from part B and fit
    an unbiased quantile estimator to them to obtain a CDF of the means and standard
    deviations.</li>
  <li>Extract the upper tailed 95% confidence value from this CDF for the mean and
    standard deviations (i.e. make a table of quantiles close to 0.95 and their associated
    values)</li>
  <li>Using the sample mean and standard deviation from the 1977-2017 data in
    problem 1, what would you conclude about the statistical significance of these
    values (alpha = 0.05). That is, based on the quantiles from your Monte Carlo
    analysis, are the observed values from 1977-2017 statistically significant for alpha =
    0.05. Are these conclusions substantially different from those in Problem 1 part B
    and E? (In other words, compare P in the two tests. You can determine P by the
    quantile values associated with the CDFs you generated here.)</li>

<p><b>Problem 3: Course Project Selection (Graduate Students Only)</b></p>

<p>Write a brief paragraph (3-9 sentences) describing your term project. Include the
name of your partner (or specify you will be doing the project alone), the data you
will analyze, and which question(s) you will answer. Which statistical tools will you
use? If you have a hypothesis to test, write it down. If you have questions about the
project, now is the time to talk to the instructor.</p>
