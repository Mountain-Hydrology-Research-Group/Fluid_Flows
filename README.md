# Fluid Flows in the Enviornment

**CEE 348**

This website is the home of labs, assignments, and resources for this class.

This course covers fundamental topics related to fluid flows in the environment, with the following learning objectives:
1)	Explain a range of flow processes in the environment and the basic physical processes that govern them
2)	Apply basic fluid mechanical principles to determine the transport and concentration of pollutants in the environment
3)	Determine the stability of the atmosphere and the processes that disperse / trap pollutants in the atmosphere
4)	Delineate a watershed
5)	Determine the flood frequency given discharge data from a watershed
6)	Compute the groundwater flow rate
7)	Predict the discharge in streams and rivers
8)	Predict the concentration of a pollutant introduced into a river


**Prerequisite:** Fluid Mechanics

**Offered:** Spring quarters
