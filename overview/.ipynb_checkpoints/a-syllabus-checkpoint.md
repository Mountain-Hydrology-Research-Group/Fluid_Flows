# Syllabus: CEE 348

## Course Overview

**Fluid Flows in the Environment - Spring Quarter, 2024**

The course introduces the fluid flows of the environment. We will survey the range of flow processes that influence the transport and dispersion of contaminants and other material in the environment and develop a framework for predicting their impact.  
Since each of the flows considered are complex, this course aims to provide only an introduction to each of the key flows. It emphasizes how the core principles of fluid mechanics apply to multiple aspects of the environmental system, as well as the key aspects of fluid flows in the environment that determine the impact of pollutants or of too much or too little water.

## Logistics and Grading

### Computing Resources

For some lab activities and assignments, we will be using a [JupyterHub](https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/Fluid_Flows/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html) computing environment, and programming with [python](https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/Fluid_Flows/resources/a-learning-python.html). 

If you need access to a laptop computer (such as if yours breaks) you may check one out from the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/). Please contact me if you need help accessing a computer reliably.


### Lectures

The first hour and a half, twice a week, is reserved for lectures and discussions.  Lecture slides will be available on Canvas, written notes on OneNote (with link posted on canvas),  along with any additional files for reading.


### Labs

On Tuesdays, we will reconvene for the lab portion of the class (this will not be recorded). Lab content (practice problems, jupyter notebooks and data files) can be downloaded directly from the from class website or from canvas. ([GitHub Option](https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/Fluid_Flows/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub))

We will use classroom space and Slack to work in small groups on Lab excercises. Contact the instructor or TA to be added to the Slack workspace.


### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments will be given out on Tuesdays at the beginning of class, and will be **due the following week on Thursday at the beginning of class (10:00 am, Pacific Time)**. Homework questions are posted on the class website along with links to any data files you might need.

You are encouraged to work together on homeworks and collaborate, but you must turn in your own assignments with your own work. 

For hand-done homework calculations, please scan or take a picture of your work and upload to canvas.

For homework using Jupyter notebooks, make sure that your name and the assignment number are at the top of your notebook file in markdown text. Your answers should be clearly labeled and written in markdown cells of the notebook.

Submit your completed homework assignments via Canvas by uploading:
* Your original .ipynb jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To download your notebook file, right click on the file in the navigation pane on JupyterHub, then click *Download*
* A PDF copy of the jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To save your notebook as a PDF, go to *File* > *Export Notebook As...* > *Export Notebook to PDF*, this will download a PDF file copy of your notebook to your personal computer which you can upload to Canvas

Homework will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Homework handed in late will be accepted up to (but not later than) Monday at midnight (Pacific Time). Homework handed in late will be deducted 10% per weekday (i.e. a late assignment that would receive a 10 if handed in on time on Thursday will be assigned a grade of 9 if handed in on Friday and 8 if handed in on Monday).   Late homework assignments will not be accepted after midnight (Pacific Time) on the Monday following the due date.  Everyone's lowest scoring homework assignment will be dropped, so please do not worry if one week is not going your way.

Homework solutions will be posted in the Solutions folder on [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/) by the Tuesday after the assignment was turned in.


### Final Project

Each person will be responsible for creating a 3 to 5-minute video explaining one of the concepts we learned in class.  We will view these videos during the regularly scheduled final exam time.


### Grading Policy

* **Exams (three at 15% each): 45%**
  * Participation includes discussions in class, on Slack, and providing feedback on student presentations
* **Homework assignments: 40%**
  * Each of the 8 homework assignments are worth 10 points (for a total of 80 points), however your lowest assignment will be dropped, and the overall homework grade will be evaluated out of 7 assignments and 70 points total.
* **Final Project: 15%**
  * See the [CEE 348 course project page](/overview/b-project.html) for grading rubric.

### Conduct

The University takes academic integrity very seriously. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. One example of misconduct I have observed in this particular class in the past is plagiarism (representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s)). **If you’re uncertain about if something is academic misconduct, ask me. I am willing to discuss questions you might have.**

[Community Standards & Student Conduct](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/)

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable as they pursue their academic goals. Allegations of misconduct by students may be referred to the appropriate campus office for investigation and resolution. More information can be found online at [https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/](https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/)


### Access and Accommodations

If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.
