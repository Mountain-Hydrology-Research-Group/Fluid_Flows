  <h1>Resources to Learn Python Programming</h1>

  <p>
    This page provides links, videos, articles, and tutorials to help you start with Python programming.

  <h2>Installing and Getting Started:</h2>

  <p>
    This section has links to download programs for this class and tutorials, articles, and videos on how to install 
    and/or get started with these programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I recommend reading/watching the articles/videos on installing programs before downloading the programs if
      you are unfamiliar to get a better understanding of how these programs are set up.</b> This may save you from 
      needing to uninstall/reinstall programs later.</b>

          Anaconda is a distribution for Python. It provides the Python language, packages, and package management.
          Overall, Anaconda makes Python easier to use. When you install Anaconda, you will also install Python. If you 
          are new to Anaconda and/or Python, I recommend the video and/or article to the right which explain how to install and 
          set up Anaconda as well as how Anaconda works. <b>When installing Anaconda/Python, you should install the latest 
          version (at least Python 3).</b>

          Jupyter Notebooks are a way to write and run Python code. After installing Anaconda, you will have access to Jupyter 
          Notebooks. They allow you to break up code into "cells" and run these cells individually. See the article on the right for more
            information on getting started with Jupyter Notebooks, including how to access them.

          Text is a good option.
