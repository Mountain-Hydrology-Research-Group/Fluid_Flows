  <h1>Resources to Learn Python Programming</h1>

  <p>Here I provide some links to download and install the programs necessary for this class. I also provide some tutorials that walk 
    you through how to do so. I recommend reading/watching these tutorials before downloading the programs to get a better understanding 
    of how these programs are set up. This may save you from needing to uninstall/reinstall programs later.
