  <h1>Resources to Learn Python Programming</h1>

  <p>Here I provide some links to download and install the programs necessary for this class. I also provide some tutorials that walk 
    you through how to do so. <b>I recommend reading/watching these tutorials before downloading the programs to get a better understanding 
    of how these programs are set up.</b> This may save you from needing to uninstall/reinstall programs later.
  </p>

  <h2>Setting Up and Using:</h2>

    <ul>
      
      <li>Python and Anaconda</li>
      
        <p style="margin-left: 2em"><i>Anaconda is a distribution for Python. It provides the Python language, packages, and package management.
          Overall, Anaconda makes Python easier to use. When you install Anaconda, you will also install Python. If you are new to Anaconda and/or 
          Python, I recommend the video and/or article below which explain how to install and set up Anaconda as well as how Anaconda works.</i></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em"><i><b>When installing Anaconda/Python, you should install the latest version (at least Python 3).</b></i></p>

      <li>Github</li>
      
      <li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em"><i>Jupyter Notebooks are a way to write and run Python code. After installing Anaconda, you will have access to Jupyter 
          Notebooks. They allow you to break up code into "cells" and run these cells individually. See the article below for more information on getting 
          started with Jupyter Notebooks, including how to access them.</i></p>

      <li>Sublime Text</li>

        <p style="margin-left: 2em"><i>Sublime Text is a text editor. It is a way to view and edit your code.</i></p>
