# Fluid Flows in the Enviornment

**CEE 348**

This website is the home of labs, assignments, and resources for this class.

This course covers fundamental topics related to fluid flows in the environment, with the following learning objectives:

* Explain a range of flow processes in the environment and the basic physical processes that govern them
* Apply basic fluid mechanical principles to determine the transport and concentration of pollutants in the environment
* Determine the stability of the atmosphere and the processes that disperse / trap pollutants in the atmosphere
* Delineate a watershed
* Determine the flood frequency given discharge data from a watershed
* Compute the groundwater flow rate
* Predict the discharge in streams and rivers
* Predict the concentration of a pollutant introduced into a river


**Prerequisite:** Fluid Mechanics

**Offered:** Spring quarters
