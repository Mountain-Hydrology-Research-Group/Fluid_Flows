### Course Website




### Slack

#### Create a new Slack workspace

1. Go to https://slack.com/create and start by entering your uw.edu email address, then entering the confirmation code sent to you.
2. For *"What's the name of your company or team?"* use the course name and year in a format like **uw-waterdata2021** (this will be the name and URL of the Slack workspace)
3. For *"What’s a project your team is working on?"* enter "projects" to create a channel with this name (a channel to discuss final projects). More channels can be added later.
4. You can click "skip" when prompted for *"Who do you email most about this project?"* (People can be added later to the workspace)
5. Then finish up by clicking *"See your slack channel"*
6. Your slack workspace should now be accessable at *uw-waterdata2021.slack.com* in a web browser, or as *uw-waterdata2021* in the Slack desktop application.
7. For a 10-week course with ~15 students, the free plan has been sufficient. For larger classes, you might hit the 10K message limit during the quarter, in which case, some early messages will not longer be visible.

#### Add people to the workspace

1. In the slack workspace, click on the workspace name on the left to open a dropdown menu.
2. Then select *Settings & Administration*, then under Administration select *Manage Members*.
3. Here you can invite people using their email addresses, as well as change their *Account Type* (such as for adding additional administrators). You can do this with list of email addresses or click the "*Get an invite link to share*" and send to an email list.
4. Set default channels to join (such as the channels mentioned below)
* More workspace settings are available on the left hand side of this admin webpage.
* Optional: add a unique icon for the workspace (useful if you are logged into many workspaces on Desktop app)

#### Set up your workspace channels

1. Add private `#admin` channel for TAs, IT staff
2. Add public `#it_help` channel for students to get help with Jupyter issues
3. Add public `#project` channel for discussion of student projects (will see more activity later in quarter)
4. Optional: limit permissions on the `#general` channel so only admins and specific users can post announcements
5. On the `#general` channel, post a new welcome message and create a quick-reference list of links to the various resources that will be used throughout the course (Jupyterhub url, Github Organization url, etc.).  
   * Pin this by clicking the three dots in upper right corner o fthe message and selecting "Pin to channel".  
   * Add a note that students can always find this list by clicking the Pin icon near top of the channel.

Example:
> **Welcome to the Data Analysis in Water Sciences - Fall 2020 Slack Workspace**
> We will be using Slack for most day-to-day communications, and for you all to collaborate on labs, homework assignments, and (for graduate students) projects.
> There is a channel for each weekly module for discussions about each lab and assignment, a channel for initiating discussion around #projects, a #general channel for announcements and general discussions, and an #it_help channel for trying to resolve issues with JupyterHub or other IT issues.
> **Please edit your Slack profile, add a picture, add your preferred name and pronouns as your "Display Name", and your time zone.**
> Please bookmark these pages for easy access:
> * **Class website**: https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/data-analysis/ (contains the syllabus, labs, homework assignments, links to other resources)
> * **UW Canvas**: https://canvas.uw.edu/ (for turning in assignments, grades, extra reading resources)
> * **JupyterHub**: https://rttl.axdd.s.uw.edu/2020-autumn-cee-465-a/ (the computing environment we’ll be using for labs, homework, projects, instructions for getting started are here)
> * **Slack Workspace**: uw-waterdata2020.slack.com (for communication, questions, collaboration)
