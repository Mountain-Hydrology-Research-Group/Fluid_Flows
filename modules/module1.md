# 1) Key Concepts in Environmental Flows



---

## Homework 1

Provide a 1-2 page write-up describing the fluid flow components of an environmental problem or concern. Please pick as specific a problem as you can (a specific case study). You are free to pick any one you want, except the examples discussed in class. In your write up, please include:

* A description of the key elements of the environmental problem

* A sketch or schematic of the flow (you can draw your own)

* Discussion of the parameters that need to be calculated to predict, understand or mitigate the problem.

* Discussion of the parameters that are needed to make that calculation.

* What fluid principles from CEE347 (Intro to fluid Mechanics) could you use?

* Which of our key words are relevant to this problem?
