# 2) Atmospheric Structure and Thermodynamics

**Recommended Reading**
For this week, we recommend reading Ch 2 and Ch 3 in Shuttleworth's [Terrestrial Hydrometerology](https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=6961&itemId=0470659378).

## Homework 2

### Problem 1

On a cold snowy morning the air temperature and dew point of the outside air are both -10&deg;C. If this air is brought indoors and warmed to 20&deg;C with no change in the vapor content, what is the relative humidity of the air inside the home?

(Note:   You may solve this using a Jupyter notebook following examples in the lab, or you may use a pen/pencil and paper.)

### Problem 2

Three cities have the following temperature (T) and dew point (Td) during a March afternoon:
| city | temperature | dew point temperature |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| San Diego, CA | T = 20&deg;C | Td = 14&deg;C |
| Spokane, WA | T = 14&deg;C | Td = -2&deg;C |
| Denver, CO | T= 24&deg;C | Td= -10&deg;C |

Which city has
* (a) the highest relative humidity?
* (b) the lowest relative humidity?
* (c) the most water vapor?
* (d) the least water vapor?

(Note:  You may solve this using a Jupyter notebook following examples in the lab, or you may use a pen/pencil and paper.)


### Problem 3
The figure below shows environmental temperature data on the west side of a conical mountain.  Suppose the wind is blowing from the west and a parcel of surface air with a temperature of 10&deg;C and a dew point of 2&deg;C begins to rise upward along the western (windward) side of the hill.

* (a) Calculate the environmental lapse rate
* (b) What type of atmospheric stability does the sounding indicate?
* (c) What is the relative humidity of the air parcel at 0 m before rising?
* (d) As the air parcel rises, at approximately what elevation would condensation begin and a cloud start to form?
* (e) What is the air temperature and dew point of the rising air at the base of the cloud?
* (f) What is the air temperature and dew point of the rising air inside the cloud at an elevation of 3000m?
* (g) At an altitude of 3000m, how does the air temperature inside the cloud compare with the temperature outside the cloud? What type of atmospheric stability does this suggest?


### Problem 4
![surface pressure](data/SurfacePressure.png)
The sea-level chart (above) is drawn for flows in the Northern Hemisphere.
* What are the magnitudes and directions (sketch this) of the geostrophic velocities at points A and B?

* Will the actual velocity magnitudes be larger or smaller than these estimates? Why?


### Problem 5: Final Presentation Topic Selection

Look at the list of topics [here](https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/Fluid_Flows/overview/b-project.html).  Write a ranked list (from 1st choice to 10th choice) of your preference for topics.  If you only have strong preferences for 5, it's okay to rank from 1st to 5th (but please include at least 5).  **If you have questions about the project or the topics, please talk to the instructor.**
